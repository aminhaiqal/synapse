Synapse by Axelyn is an open, privacy-first chat workspace that lets you plug in your own AI API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, etc.) and use advanced context tools like LlamaIndex and LangGraph.
It gives you:

A modern ChatGPT-style interface

Built-in memory and context management (via LlamaIndex + LangGraph)

Real-time token usage tracking and cost estimation

Optional vector search memory (to recall past chats or uploaded docs)

Completely modular: your data, your models, your keys

You donâ€™t pay for usage; you pay only for premium features like persistent cloud memory or advanced analytics.
